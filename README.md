I'm a recent graduate in data engineering with a broad scientific background and culture. At the beginning of my studies, I wanted to become an astrophysicist, and I ended up becoming a “nerd” fascinated by code and artificial intellienge. My final year internship and a few other experiences gave me skills I'm proud of today.

Beyond my technical skills, I am a lifelong tennis enthusiast. The sport has taught me resilience, mental fortitude, and the importance of embracing challenges. It fuels my competitive spirit and drives me to consistently push my limits, both on and off the court.

Currently, I’m actively seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge and contribute to innovative data solutions while continuing to work on personal projects that enhance my expertise. I've already published a few of them on LinkedIn.

I'm looking for a job, ideally full remote, that would allow me to work in/from France or South America. I have a preference for positions related to machine learning, but any other opportunity related to data engineering and data science could interest me, as long as it feeds my curiosity.

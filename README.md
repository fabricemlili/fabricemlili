I'm a recent graduate in data engineering with a broad scientific background and culture. At the beginning of my studies, I wanted to become an astrophysicist, and I ended up becoming a “nerd” fascinated by code and artificial intellienge. My final year internship and a few other experiences gave me skills I'm proud of today.

In 2024, one of my biggest dreams came true: I went on a solo backpacking roadtrip in Argentina. It may be cliché, but it's true - I learned so much about myself, and now I've come to realize what I really want. My keen interest in exploring new cultures and my taste for adventure have always pushed me to expand my comfort zone.

Since I've been back from that trip, Since I’m back from my trip, I've been playing tennis every week (and exercising every day). It's a lifelong passion that teaches me to be mentally stronger and to accept that I can't always control events. I also think it drives me to go beyond my limits and feeds my love of competition. 

Of course, I'm not just sitting back and doing nothing other but looking for a job. I've gone back to my previous job and, in parallel, I'm doing lots of small data projects to improve my skills. I've already published a few of them on LinkedIn.

I'm looking for a job, ideally full remote, that would allow me to work in/from France or South America. I have a preference for positions related to machine learning, but any other opportunity related to engineering and data science could interest me, as long as it feeds my curiosity.
